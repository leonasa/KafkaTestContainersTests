# KafkaTestContainersTests - Sample with Schema Registry.

I use Testcontainers to run a simple test suing  Schema Registry.

`Testcontainers for .NET is a library to support tests with throwaway instances of Docker containers for all compatible .NET Standard versions. The library is built on top of the .NET Docker remote API and provides a lightweight implementation to support your test environment in all circumstances.`

Follow [testcontainers-dotnet](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) for more details.
